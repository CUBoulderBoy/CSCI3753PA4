---Dependencies (all included in cu-cs-csci3753 package)---
fuse-utils
openssl
attr
attr-dev
libfuse-dev
libssl1.0.0 or libssl0.9.8
libssl-dev

Note: To use extended attributes (xattr) on EXT filesystems,
      you must add the 'user_xattr' mount option to the
      mount options of any mounts on which you intend to use 
      extended attributes. Failure to so may result in an error
      when trying to set, get, or remove xattr values.

---Examples---

***Building***

Build All:
 make

Build Fuse Custom File System and Utilities:
 make pa4-encfs

Clean:
 make clean

***Custom FUSE Filesystem Examples***

Mount pa4-encfs on existing directory and list (ls) mirrored specified directory
 ./pa4-encfs <Keyphrase> <Root Directory> <Mount Point>
 ls <Mount Point>

***You create, read, and write files in this system the same way that you would 
in a standard file system.  I used vi and sublime text for my editors.

Unmount a FUSE filesystem
 fusermount -u <Mount Point>
